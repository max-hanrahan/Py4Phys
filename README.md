Projects from Old Dominion University's "Python 4 Physics" course.
## Notable Projects

### Modeling
The project of which I am most proud can be found in the [COVD Models folder](https://github.com/max-hanrahan/Py4Phys/tree/master/COVID%20Models). Inside there is a toy interactive model based around the [SIRD Model](https://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/202007/lessons.cfm) for epidemiological modeling. However, since jupyter notebooks render as static HTML files on GitHub and don't allow for interaction, I've included a .py file designed to reproduce the same interactive plot.

### Data analysis/data fitting
Additionally, ODU's Python4Physics course helped me solidify skills in data analysis and data fitting as well. The most interesting task in this category was calculating pi by use of random numbers and use Matplotlib to visually display the data.

As for fitting data, there was an interesting exercise involving the use of scipy's optimize tool to fit to different distributions, in particular fitting the Breit-Wigner Distribution to real data by minimizing its Chi-Squared value. I think this will serve as a good basis for future problems in optimization.
